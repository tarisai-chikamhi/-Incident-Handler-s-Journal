## 📅 Entry 1 – Ransomware Incident Analysis

**Date:** April 21, 2026  

### Description
This entry documents a ransomware incident at a healthcare clinic where phishing emails were used to deliver malware. The attack encrypted critical patient data and disrupted operations. This aligns with the **Detection and Analysis** phase of the NIST Incident Response Lifecycle.

### Tools Used
No specific tools were used in this initial stage. The incident was identified through employee reports and system behavior. In real-world scenarios, SIEM and endpoint detection tools would assist in identifying ransomware activity.

### The 5 W’s
- **Who:** Organized cybercriminal group targeting healthcare organizations  
- **What:** Ransomware attack encrypting patient data  
- **When:** Tuesday at approximately 9:00 a.m.  
- **Where:** Internal network of a healthcare clinic  
- **Why:** Phishing email with malicious attachment enabled unauthorized access  

### Additional Notes
This incident highlights the importance of employee security awareness training and strong email filtering controls to prevent phishing attacks.

## 📅 Entry 2 – Network Traffic Analysis

**Date:** April 21, 2026  

### Description
This entry documents the analysis of suspicious network traffic using packet capture tools. The activity involved identifying DNS requests and ICMP errors. This aligns with the **Detection and Analysis** phase of incident response.

### Tools Used
- `tcpdump`  
- Packet analyzer  

These tools were used to capture and analyze network traffic. The analysis revealed DNS queries failing with ICMP “port unreachable” errors, which may indicate misconfiguration or malicious interference.

### The 5 W’s
- **Who:** Internal system or potential attacker generating traffic  
- **What:** DNS requests failing with ICMP errors  
- **When:** During packet capture session  
- **Where:** Communication between host and DNS server  
- **Why:** Possible DNS service issue or blocked port 53  

### Additional Notes
Understanding network protocols is essential for identifying abnormal traffic and investigating potential threats.

## 📅 Entry 3 – SIEM Log Analysis

**Date:** April 21, 2026  

### Description
This entry describes the use of a SIEM tool to analyze logs and detect suspicious login attempts. The activity focused on identifying repeated failed login attempts, which may indicate a brute-force attack. This aligns with the **Detection and Analysis** phase.

### Tools Used
- SIEM platform (e.g., Splunk, Chronicle)  

SIEM tools aggregate logs from multiple systems and allow analysts to query data for anomalies, improving detection of unauthorized access attempts.

### The 5 W’s
- **Who:** Potential attacker attempting unauthorized access  
- **What:** Multiple failed login attempts detected in logs  
- **When:** During log analysis session  
- **Where:** Authentication system logs  
- **Why:** Possible brute-force attack targeting user accounts  

### Additional Notes
SIEM platforms are critical for centralized visibility, enabling rapid detection and response to suspicious activity.

## 📅 Entry 4 – Suspicious File Hash Investigation

**Date:** April 21, 2026  

### Description
This entry documents the investigation of a suspicious file hash using threat intelligence tools. The objective was to determine whether the file was malicious. This aligns with the **Detection and Analysis** phase of the NIST Incident Response Lifecycle.

### Tools Used
- VirusTotal  
- Threat intelligence databases  

These tools were used to compare file hashes against known malware signatures and identify potential threats.

### The 5 W’s
- **Who:** Unknown malicious actor  
- **What:** Malicious file attachment identified via SHA-256 hash  
- **When:** Alert triggered at approximately 1:20 p.m.  
- **Where:** Employee workstation in a financial services environment  
- **Why:** User downloaded and executed a malicious email attachment  

### Additional Notes
Hash analysis is an efficient method for identifying known threats and validating security alerts.

# 🧠 Reflections

### Challenges
Using command-line tools like `tcpdump` was initially challenging due to unfamiliar syntax. However, repeated practice improved my ability to capture and analyze network traffic effectively.

### Learning Progress
My understanding of incident detection and response has significantly improved. I now understand the full lifecycle of incident handling, including detection, analysis, and the role of various security tools.

### Key Interest
I found network traffic analysis particularly engaging. Tools like Wireshark and tcpdump provide deep insight into network behavior and are essential for identifying and investigating threats.
